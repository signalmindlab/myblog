## Why VS Code for LaTeX?

Visual Studio Code with the LaTeX Workshop extension has become the go-to editor for many academic writers. It combines powerful editing features, seamless PDF preview, intelligent autocomplete, and Git integration—all in one lightweight package. But to truly unlock its potential, you need to master the keyboard shortcuts.

This comprehensive cheatsheet covers everything from basic compilation to advanced multi-cursor editing, helping you write academic papers faster and with fewer errors.

**Note for Mac users:** Replace `Ctrl` with `Cmd (⌘)` and `Alt` with `Option (⌥)` throughout this guide.

## Building & Compiling

These are your most frequently used commands for compiling LaTeX documents and viewing output.

| Shortcut                | Action                                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl + Alt + B`        | Build LaTeX project                       |
| `Ctrl + Alt + R`        | Build with default recipe                 |
| `Ctrl + Alt + V`        | View PDF output                           |
| `Ctrl + Alt + J`        | SyncTeX forward: Jump from source to PDF  |
| `Ctrl + Click` (in PDF) | SyncTeX backward: Jump from PDF to source |
| `Ctrl + Alt + C`        | Clean auxiliary files (.aux, .log, etc.)  |
| `Ctrl + L, Ctrl + W`    | Show LaTeX Workshop panel                 |

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

If `Ctrl + Alt + B` doesn't work:

1. Open Command Palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P`
2. Type "LaTeX Workshop: Build LaTeX project"
3. Press Enter

For bibliography issues, run the complete build sequence manually in the terminal:

```bash
pdflatex manuscript.tex
bibtex manuscript
pdflatex manuscript.tex
pdflatex manuscript.tex
```

## Document Navigation

Efficiently navigate through large LaTeX documents with hundreds of pages.

| Shortcut           | Action                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Ctrl + Home`      | Jump to beginning of file                  |
| `Ctrl + End`       | Jump to end of file                        |
| `Ctrl + G`         | Go to specific line number                 |
| `Ctrl + Shift + O` | Go to symbol (sections/subsections/labels) |
| `Ctrl + T`         | Show all symbols in workspace              |
| `Ctrl + Shift + .` | Focus breadcrumb navigation                |
| `Alt + ←`          | Navigate back to previous location         |
| `Alt + →`          | Navigate forward to next location          |
| `Ctrl + U`         | Undo cursor movement                       |

### Pro Navigation Workflow

The most powerful navigation feature is `Ctrl + Shift + O`. This opens a searchable list of all sections, subsections, and labels in your document.

**Example workflow:**

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + O`
2. Type "methodology" to filter sections
3. Press Enter to jump directly to that section
4. Use `Alt + ←` to return to where you were

This is far faster than scrolling through a 100-page thesis!

## Working with References & Citations

Jump between citations, labels, and their definitions seamlessly.

| Shortcut       | Action                                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl + Click` | Jump to label/citation definition             |
| `F12`          | Go to definition                              |
| `Alt + F12`    | Peek definition (view inline without leaving) |
| `Shift + F12`  | Find all references to current symbol         |
| `F2`           | Rename symbol (renames all instances)         |

### Citation Management Tips

**View citation without jumping:** Hold `Ctrl` and hover over any `\ref{}` or `\cite{}` to see a preview.

**Find orphaned labels:** Use `Shift + F12` on a label to see where it's referenced. If the list is empty, that label isn't used anywhere.

**Rename labels safely:** Put your cursor on a label name and press `F2`. This renames it everywhere in your project, preventing broken references.

## Code Folding

Collapse and expand sections to focus on specific parts of your document.

| Shortcut             | Action                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl + Shift + [`   | Fold (collapse) current section          |
| `Ctrl + Shift + ]`   | Unfold (expand) current section          |
| `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + 0` | Fold all sections                        |
| `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + J` | Unfold all sections                      |
| `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + 1` | Fold to level 1 (show sections only)     |
| `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + 2` | Fold to level 2 (sections + subsections) |

### Document Structure at a Glance

Press `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + 1` to fold everything to the top level. This gives you a bird's-eye view of your document structure:

```latex
\section{Introduction}
...

\section{Literature Review}
...

\section{Methodology}
...

\section{Results}
...

\section{Discussion}
...
```

Click on any section to expand just that part. This is invaluable for reorganizing large documents.
