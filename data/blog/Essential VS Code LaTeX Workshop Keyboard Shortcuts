If you're writing LaTeX documents in VS Code with the LaTeX Workshop extension, mastering keyboard shortcuts can dramatically speed up your workflow. Here's a comprehensive guide to the most useful shortcuts for building, viewing, and navigating your LaTeX PDFs.

## Why Use Keyboard Shortcuts?

When you're deep in writing mode, switching between keyboard and mouse breaks your flow. These shortcuts keep your hands on the keyboard and your mind on the content.

## Building & Viewing Your PDF

### Core Compilation Shortcuts

- **`Ctrl+Alt+B`** (Windows/Linux) / **`Cmd+Option+B`** (Mac)  
  Build your LaTeX project. This runs your configured build recipe (usually pdfLaTeX or XeLaTeX).

- **`Ctrl+Alt+V`** / **`Cmd+Option+V`**  
  View the compiled PDF. Opens the PDF viewer if it's not already open, or refreshes if it is.

- **`Ctrl+Alt+J`** / **`Cmd+Option+J`**  
  SyncTeX forward search - jumps from your current cursor position in the `.tex` file to the corresponding location in the PDF. Incredibly useful for long documents!

### Emergency Controls

- **`Ctrl+Alt+X` then `Ctrl+Alt+V`**  
  Kill the current build process and view PDF. Use this when a build hangs or you need to force-stop compilation.

## Navigating Between Source and PDF

One of LaTeX Workshop's best features is bidirectional navigation between source and PDF:

### PDF → Source (Reverse SyncTeX)

- **Right-click in PDF** → Select "Go to Source"  
- **`Ctrl+Click`** (or `Cmd+Click`) anywhere in the PDF  
  
Both methods jump back to the corresponding line in your `.tex` file.

### Source → PDF (Forward SyncTeX)

- **`Ctrl+Alt+J`** / **`Cmd+Option+J`**  
  As mentioned above, this takes you from code to the rendered PDF location.

## Essential Editor Shortcuts

### File Operations

- **`Ctrl+S`** / **`Cmd+S`**  
  Save your file. If you enable auto-build (see below), this automatically recompiles your PDF!

- **`Ctrl+Shift+P`** / **`Cmd+Shift+P`**  
  Open Command Palette. Type "LaTeX" to see all available LaTeX Workshop commands.

### Code Assistance

- **`Ctrl+Space`**  
  Trigger IntelliSense/autocomplete for LaTeX commands, citations, references, and more.

- **`Ctrl+/`** / **`Cmd+/`**  
  Comment/uncomment selected lines (adds `%` in LaTeX).

## Managing Your Workspace

### Split View Setup

- **`Ctrl+\`** / **`Cmd+\`**  
  Split the editor vertically. Perfect for placing your PDF viewer side-by-side with your source code.

- **`Ctrl+1`, `Ctrl+2`, `Ctrl+3`**  
  Switch focus between editor groups (e.g., between your `.tex` file and PDF viewer).

- **`Ctrl+W`** / **`Cmd+W`**  
  Close the current editor tab.

### Quick Navigation

- **`Ctrl+P`** / **`Cmd+P`**  
  Quick open file by name (great for multi-file projects).

- **`Ctrl+Tab`** / **`Cmd+Tab`**  
  Switch between recently opened files.

## Pro Tips & Configuration

### Enable Auto-Build on Save

Add this to your VS Code `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "latex-workshop.latex.autoBuild.run": "onSave"
}
```

Now every time you hit `Ctrl+S`, your PDF automatically rebuilds. No more manual `Ctrl+Alt+B`!

### Customize Your Own Shortcuts

1. Open **File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts** (or `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`)
2. Search for "latex-workshop"
3. Click the pencil icon next to any command to assign your preferred keybinding

### Useful Commands to Bind

Consider creating custom shortcuts for:
- `latex-workshop.clean` - Clean auxiliary files
- `latex-workshop.citation` - Insert citation
- `latex-workshop.addtexroot` - Set main TeX file in multi-file projects

## My Recommended Workflow

Here's how I typically work:

1. **Split editor** (`Ctrl+\`) with `.tex` on left, PDF preview on right
2. **Enable auto-build on save** for instant feedback
3. **Use SyncTeX** (`Ctrl+Alt+J`) constantly to check rendered output
4. **Navigate back** with `Ctrl+Click` in PDF when reviewing

This keeps both hands on the keyboard and maintains focus on writing.

## Troubleshooting

**PDF won't update?**
- Try `Ctrl+Alt+X` then `Ctrl+Alt+V` to kill and restart
- Check the Output panel (`Ctrl+Shift+U`) for build errors

**SyncTeX not working?**
- Ensure `\synctex=1` is in your build recipe
- LaTeX Workshop usually handles this automatically

## Conclusion

These shortcuts transform VS Code into a powerful LaTeX IDE. The initial learning curve pays off quickly - after a few days, they'll become muscle memory. Start with the core shortcuts (`Ctrl+Alt+B`, `Ctrl+Alt+V`, `Ctrl+Alt+J`) and gradually add more to your repertoire.
