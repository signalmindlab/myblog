### Step 2: Search for Your Product

You can search in two ways:

**Option A: Use the Search Bar**

- Be as specific as possible (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro 256GB" rather than just "iPhone")
- Press Enter or click the search icon

**Option B: Browse by Category**

- Use the left sidebar to browse categories (컴퓨터/노트북 for computers, 가전 for appliances, etc.)

### Step 3: Review the Results

You'll see a list of matching products with:
