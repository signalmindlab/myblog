I'm a Research Professor at Yeungnam University, South Korea, working at the intersection of signal processing, deep learning, and explainable AI — with applications in wireless networks, medical imaging, IoT sensor networks, and intelligent systems. I've published 60+ SCIE/SSCI papers. I did my Ph.D. at Chosun University as a GKS-PhD scholarship winner with NRF Korea funding.
